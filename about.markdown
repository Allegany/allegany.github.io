Hi! I'm a 34 year old man living in Örebro in Sweden and I'm studying "Web programming" in Linneaus University.
I live together with my wife and my son who soon is two years old and we live in a house just outside the town.

I have worked more than 13 years of my life with logistics in the waste industry but quite recently decided to take a big jump
and educate me to start working in the web development industry that has been a private interest back and forth. When I was younger
I created some simpler websites. And for about two years ago my interest raised significally again and I have since then taken some online-courses
at Udemy, Lynda.com and of course Youtube to especially learn HTML, CSS & JavaScript better.

Otherwise I like to photograph in my spare time. This is just a hobby but I take portrait photos and actually also photos of birds. Otherwise I all in to 
sports, looking that is, not perfoming. I especially like cross country skiing were I dont miss a race in a season. I also like football and hockey 
(Örebro in top of the league right now as I'm writing this - Yay!).
